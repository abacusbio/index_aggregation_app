# Help-Index Viewer

Once you clicked **Filter and save** buttons on **Preprocess Files** step, the dimension of the index matrix will be displayed here
in the grey text box. The green word *Index calculated. Now you can download and go to the next steps.* will display as a sign that
your index matrix is successfully calculated.

It's recommended to click the left side download button to save your index file.
